
# STATECHUNK
#
# Most Wwise objects can define properties + values to be used when a state in set ("states" tab).
# For example could change object's volume=-96 when state bgm_type=silent. This info is saved into
# a "StateChunk". StateChunks only define info for active states, so "none" is not allowed.
#
# These are often used to silence tracks using states (ex. MGR, DMC)
# In rare cases also used to slightly increase volume from one track (Monster Hunter World's 3221323256.bnk).
