# BUILDER
# Takes the parsed bank nodes and rebuilds them to simpler "builder node" (bnode) objects
# with quick access to useful attributes. These bnodes will be later used to generate txtp.
#
# Only used with registered HIRC objects, that have a shortID. Different Wwise parts reuse
# the same HIRC objects, so bnodes are meant to be created once and read-only. 
# Common sub-objects that each HIRC has (like AkRTPCs) are constructed per HIRC using regular
# classes that act like bnodes.
