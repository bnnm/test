# USAGE EXAMPLES

Info about how games use Wwise in more unusual cases, for reference.

Path info (`event > play > ...`) isn't meant to be complete, as most games mix the usual paths.


## Wwise demo (PC)
- mixes sample rates in layers
- musicranseqs loop parts


## Xenoblade Definitive Edition (Switch)
```
BGM.bnk
    event > play > sound

    event > play > switch > sound
```
- sets loop flag and source has loop points
  - a few sources don't, but are meant to full loop instead
- doesn't set loop flag if file isn't meant to loop, file has no loop points
- doesn't use anything more complex than that


## Pokemon Sword & Shield (Switch)

```
- plays songs as one musicranseq with start+loop (different files), sets loop flag for track-loop
- clips don't set trims and are used as-is
- some musicranseqs mix 2 different sample rates, automatically handled by the engine (no flags)
- has play events pointing to non-existing ids
- some switches point to object 0
- has clip automations to handle fades

```
- uses internal sounds (banks), may set full loops
- uses ranseqs for sfx (gunshots, steps, etc)
- uses ranseq + ranseq for gunshot + echo (sound1 shorter than sound2, no delay?)
- uses subtracks + switch to make normal/action song variation
- subtracks may be empty (plays silence)
- some tracks play super-extended playtime with loop count
- sets sLoopCount in ranseq but doesn't loop?
- may apply pitch or other effects
- mswitch groups contain volumes

```
- uses "single trimmed wem to fake looping", but may need multiple segments to loop (not simulable with loop points)
- some of the looping parts have wem IDs not sorted (since they are ordered by segment/track ID)
- some files have many infinite loops defined, but can only play first one
- overlapped (layered) parts in transitions use very short fades (0.01s) so change between segments is smoother
  - in effect just trying to mask potential clips

                               \ musicranseq > segment > track
```
- some musicranseq only have one
- track sets loop flag for full loops (musicranseq also sets it?)
- some CAkSwitch use StateChunk/SwitchList/rParams (related to gamesyncs)
- check CAkSwitch (ex. 4033386954)

```
[778418041]

```
- one switch has 2 sounds nodes at once with some delay (rare)
- all songs set full loops? (even jingles)

```
- dynamic BGM is done with switches + transitions
  - base loop type 1 > switch change > loop type 2 > switch change > loop type 2 > ...
  - switches define transitions: entry/exit points + "on beat", that the engine properly delays/adjust
  - may also use a transition segment between mranseqs
- sections are directly accesible if proper switches are set
- many variables (+30)
- has empty stingers that don't actually point to another segment, and trigger ID isn't defined
- uses empty segments as padding
- has unused transition? segments (in children but not used) 
- uses volume states to add layers
  - sometimes selects one from N
  - others uses base layer + silenced/non-silenced layer
  - ex. `bgm_m07_stage.bnk` path `bgm_mission=m07_st01` with volume states:
    - `bgm_battle=off` sets combat layer to `-96.0db`
    - `bgm_battle=on_stage` sets combat layer to `+2.0db`
  - ex. `bgm_m04_boss.bnk` path `bgm_boss=em5200_bat_start/em5200_trueform`: 
    - `bgm_boss=em5200_trueform` leaves default volumes (no volume state defined)
    - `bgm_boss=em5200_bat_start` sets combat layer to `-96.0db`
    - other `bgm_boss` volume states aren't really possible since they can't exists with current path
      - sometimes leads to unreachable variations: 
        - `play_m08_boss_bgm (bgm_boss=em5900_intro_m08) {s}=~(bgm_boss=em5900_bat_end)`
      - unreachable variations may be possible if change times are long enough?

```
- may call triggers, that refer by tid to current mranseq's triggers
  (in bank, event calling trigger may exist before mranseqs)
  - basically 1 trigger > N "finish stinger" tracks
- musicranseqs have CAkStingers with a trigger ID (presumably triggered with CAkActionTrigger)
  and a music segment
- has multiple unused objects
- musicranseq playlists (ex. 729873617) mix parts like

- some events set multiple loop infinites (only innermost would be used)
- some events set loop infinite, but have a song end after it (never plays)
- some events in EV.bnk (events only) point to ME.bnk (media only) media
- most layers use sounds with MakeUpGain = -96dB to silence parts, rather than regular volume

- loads multiple banks (mainly *persistent_eventsOnly.bnk* as base + other)
- events can be used before they appear in the ordered bank (objects calls eventId)
- sets multiple infinite loops in some mranseqs (would loop the innermost one)
- sets multiple infinite loops in sounds, and random groups, and others
- loops single elements
- combines start sound + looping random (not actually random), where loop doesn't include sound
  - hard to simulate as a loop
- may start a sound and trigger a stinger to stop previous sound
  - different mranseqs use the same trigger-ids to call same segment
- some objects use pitch changes
- multiple banks save the same .wem in different media index, but same ID

```
- tracks have random type but point to the same object
- has switch variables that aren't accesible
- has vocal songs in multiple languages (set as localized banks)
- uses variable 0x27 [FadeOutTime]
- has a lot of strange usage of features to achieve effects in twisted ways (inexperienced?)
  - ex. creates many sequential clips to loop a track of few seconds, that is also silenced most of the time
  - this is rather cheap in Wwise (ie. N nodes = 1 playlist of same things) but makes lots of VGMSTREAMs in .txtp,
    reaching the max segment limit and failing to open

```
- uses wmid mixed with .wem (used to sync audio and visuals)
- uses multiple 2ch vocals that use a peak meter + gain FX plugin to silence
  - presumably only used to read peak values and aren't output
  - vo_bus then calls bgm_bus

- has an infinite looping step sequence, in effect a regular sequence
- different banks contain *same object IDs* but with *different number of children*
  - in theory not possible, unless they make one bank, modify the object and make another bank (or copy projects)
  - probably never loaded at the same time (not allowed by Wwise?)

- has an infinite looping step sequence, in effect a regular sequence

```
- has a buggy/imprecise transitions, where it jumps early and ~3ms/145 samples are cut off
  - this matters in some songs where some source files have a click at the end
  - rarely and randomly, songs play fully instead of jumping early on real systems, resulting in a click
  - bank version ~v34 PC, also heard in PS3 version
  - sometimes may also extend/jump late?

## Gunslinger Stratos Reloaded (PC)
```
3991942870 music: BusVolume=-18.0

  - also defines RTPC "MusicVol_Parameter" controlling bus volume
- some BGM define both volume and makeupgain for a resulting 7-9dB

```
- has multi-actions that point to different switches (with sub-switches) at the same time
  - only one path plays due to how variables are set up
- repeats several CAkFxShareSet and CAkAuxBus IDs (like Init.bnk's 2050183431=POKEDEXEQ_01)
  - allowed by the editor, won't error

- has volume states with custom buses to silence action/exploration layers
  - when BGM_Layer=mid, bus "low" is silent
  - when BGM_Layer=low, bus "mid" is silent
- some intro + loop have slightly -1db volume intro, but seems to keep volume consistent (different wems)
  - `BGM_Initialize (BGM_Stage=bt_2legs) (BGM_Bt_2legs=bt_2legs_1)`
  - `BGM_Initialize (BGM_Stage=bt_jena_1)`
- some use several curves to lower volume parts in some tracks
  - `BGM_Initialize (BGM_Stage=ot_emergency)`

## Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair
- has BusVolume states with custom buses to silence regular/8bit layers
  - when MUS_8BIT=DISABLED, bus "MUSIC_8BIT" is silent

```
- has tree paths that fail then use *
  - ex. (BGM_battle_normal_outro=none)(BGM_battle_normal=bt_moon)
  - on first mswitch actually uses BGM_battle_normal_outro=*: nothing for none+bt_moon, tries *+bt_moon
- simulates loops by changing states?
  - ex. starts with region_01, changes to region_02, region_03... (Wwise waits and swaps to next mtrack)
